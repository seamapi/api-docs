An **Ongoing** Access Code will be active until it has been removed from the Device. Be sure to leave both the **`starts_at`** and **`ends_at`** fields empty to specify an ongoing Access Code.

A **Time Bound** Access Code will be programmed at the **`starts_at`**time, and removed at the **`ends_at`** time.

## Access Code Error Types

Errors are returned in a list:

```
"errors": [
  {
    "is_access_code_error": true,
    "error_code": "device_disconnected",
    "message": "Device Disconnected, you may need to reconnect the device.",
    "created_at": "2023-06-27T22:50:19.440Z
  }
]
```

### Generic Errors

Seam recommends adding error handling logic to you application for each generic error below.
Seam may add more generic errors in the future, so your application should include a fallback case
if it encounters an unknown generic error code.

| Error Type                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `failed_to_set_on_device`        | An error occurred when we tried to set the access code on the device. We will continue to try and set the code on the device in case the error was temporary.                                                                                                                                                             |
| `failed_to_remove_from_device`   | An error occurred when we tried to remove the access code from the device. We will continue to try and remove the code from the device in case the error was temporary.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `code_modified_external_to_seam` | We detected that the code was modified or removed externally after Seam successfully set it on the device. We will attempt to set the code on the device again. Please advise the user that Seam will re-set codes they modify or remove manually, and to review other lock integrations that may be modifying the codes. |

### Specific Errors

When Seam is able to provide more specific information beyond one of the generic errors above,
one or more errors from the list of specific errors may appear.
This gives your application the option to display additional context or suggest provider specific resolutions.

{% hint style="info" %}
If the device or connected account associated with an access code has an error, it will be attached to the access code
alongside any other access code errors.
Treat these errors as Specific Errors.
See [Device Error Types](../devices/#device-error-types) and [Connected Account Error Types](../connected-accounts/#connected-account-error-types).

We recommend disabling RBoy Apps for devices that will be managed using Seam. |
| `smartthings_no_free_slots_available`              | There are no free slots available on the device. You will need to delete existing codes before more codes can be added to the device. Note that in addition to the codes managed by Seam, there are 3 other codes on the device.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Access Code Warning Types

{% hint style="info" %}
An access code can have more than one error or warning.
{% endhint %}

Warnings are returned in a list:

```
"warnings": [
  {
    "warning_code": "delay_in_removing_from_device ",
    "message": "We expected the device to report that the access code has been removed but it still has not.",
    "created_at": "2023-06-27T22:50:19.440Z
  }
]
```

| Warning Type                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `delay_in_removing_from_device` | We expected the device to report that the access code has been removed but it still has not. We will continue to try and remove the code from the device.                                                                                       |
| `delay_in_setting_on_device`    | There was an unusually long delay in programming the code onto the device. For time bound codes, this is sent when the code enters its active time. Note that this is a temporary warning and might be removed if the code is successfully set. |
