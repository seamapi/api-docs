# Connect Webviews

## Introduction to Connect Webview



Connect Webview is a component that your users will interact with in order to link their smart devices to Seam and allow you to access their devices via the Seam API.

Seam Connect Webview will handle credential validation, multi-factor authentication, and error handling for each device type that we support.

To allow a user to sign in, you need to create a `connect_webview` . After creating the webview, you'll receive a URL that you can use to open an iframe or new window containing a login page for your user.
