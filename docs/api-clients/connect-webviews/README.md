# Connect Webviews

The `connect_webview` object represents a [Connect Webview](../../core-concepts/connect-webviews/). Connect Webviews are fully-embedded client-side components that you add to your app. Your users interact with your embedded Connect Webviews to link their IoT device accounts to Seam. That is, Connect Webviews walk your users through the process of logging in to their device accounts. Seam handles all the authentication steps, and—once your user has completed the authorization through your app—you can access and control their devices using the Seam API.

Connect Webviews perform credential validation, multifactor authentication (when applicable), and error handling for each device brand that Seam supports. Further, Connect Webviews work across all modern browsers and platforms, including Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.

To enable a user to connect their device account to Seam through your app, you must first create a `connect_webview`. Once created, this `connect_webview` includes a URL that you can use to open an [iframe](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html\_iframe.asp) or new window containing the Connect Webview for your user.
