# Delete a Connected Account

{% hint style="warning" %}
Deleting a connected account account device will trigger a `connected_account.deleted` event and remove the connected account and all data associated with the connected account from Seam: devices, events, access codes, etc. This action is irreversible.

For every deleted resource, a corresponding deleted event will be sent, but the resource will not be deleted from the provider.
For example, deleting a connected account with a device that has an access code will send a `connected_account.deleted` event, a `device.deleted` event, and an `access_code.deleted` event,
but Seam will not remove the access code from the device.
