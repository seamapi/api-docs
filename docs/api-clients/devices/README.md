### Generic Errors

Seam recommends adding error handling logic to you application for each generic error below.
Seam may add more generic errors in the future, so your application should include a fallback case
if it encounters an unknown generic error code.

| Error Type            | Description                                                                                        |

| `device_removed`      | Device has been removed from the Connected Account. Seam can no longer sync with this device.      |
| `hub_disconnected`    | The hub that the device is connected to is offline. Seam is unable to sync updates to this device. |

### Specific Errors

When Seam is able to provide more specific information beyond one of the generic errors above,
one or more errors from the list of specific errors may appear.
This gives your application the option to display additional context or suggest provider specific resolutions.

{% hint style="info" %}
If the connected account associated with a device has an error, it will be attached to the device
alongside any other device errors.
Treat these errors as Specific Errors.
See [Connected Account Error Types](../connected-accounts/#connected-account-error-types).

| **`cannot_start_with_12`**          | The pin code cannot start with the sequence of digits `12`.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **`no_triple_consecutive_ints`**    | No more than 3 digits in a row can be consecutive or the same in the pin code.                                                                                                                                                        |
| **`cannot_specify_pin_code`**       | A pin code cannot be specified - it has to be left empty and one will be generated by the lock provider.                                                                                                                              |
| **`pin_code_matches_existing_set`** | If a pin code is specified, it must match an existing set of pin codes used in the account (for example, pin code matches the code assigned to a user in the system).                                                                 |
| **`start_date_in_future`**          | For time-bound codes, the start date has to be in the future.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **`name_length`**                   | The name of the code has some restrictions on length. When the `constraint_type` is `name_length`, the constraint object has one or two additional properties called `min_length` and `max_length` to specify the length constraints. |
