# Obtaining ASSA ABLOY Certification for Your Visionline Mobile App

To put your Visionline mobile app for issuing mobile keys into production, you must first obtain ASSA ABLOY certification. This certification process consists of the following steps:

* Answer a series of questions about your app. The categories of questions include app development and deployment, user authentication, credential issuance, mobile device handling, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) reader integration, use cases, troubleshooting and support, and so on.
* Perform a set of pre-verification tests. Failing any of the pre-verification tests can result in a delay in the approval process.

Work with the ASSA ABLOY and Seam teams to achieve certification.

## Next Steps

Once your app is certified, ASSA ABLOY provides you with a production tenant account and production application ID for your mobile app. You can then [launch one or more Visionline production sites](launching-your-visionline-production-sites.md).&#x20;
