# Climate Setting Schedules

A Climate Setting Schedule allows you to set up a thermostat HVAC mode setting (heating, cooling, or off) and desired temperature set points during a time frame.

For instance, if you are a short-term-rental host who has a guest staying from Jan 1st - Jan 7th, you can create a Climate Setting Schedule that sets the thermostat to a climate setting (i.e. Heat to 70°C) throughout that guest's stay.

When there are no active Climate Setting Schedules, the thermostat will fallback to its [Default Climate Setting](../../api-clients/thermostats/lock-a-lock.md). For example, if you are a short-term-rental host, you have configure a more energy-saving temperature setting here (i.e. Heat to 45°C).
