## Climate Set Points

When heating is turned on, you will need to set a heating set point. When the ambient temperature drops below this set point, heating will turn on.

When cooling is turned on, you will need to set a cooling set point. When the ambient temperature rises above this set point, cooling will turn on.

When you have `heat_cool` turned on, where both heating and cooling systems are enabled, you will need to set heating and cooling set points. The cooling set point needs to be set to a temperature higher than that of the heating set point. On some systems, there might also be a minimum difference between the heating and cooling set points.
