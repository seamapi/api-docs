# üå©Ô∏è Seam Bridge

## Overview

The Seam Bridge enables you to connect on-premises software systems to the Seam platform. Consisting of an executable file (that is, an application), the Seam Bridge is easy to install on an on-premises computer. Once installed, the Seam Bridge creates a Seam Network and functions as a secure intermediary, facilitating network requests between Seam and the on-premises network. This setup aims to enable smooth communication between cloud-based services and existing local systems, while prioritizing data security and network integrity.

## System Requirements

* **Operating System:** Window 7 or later versions
* **Memory:** At least 1 GB of RAM
* **Network:** LAN connection required

## Installation Instructions

To install the Seam Bridge, first install the Seam Bridge application on an on-premises computer. Then, pair the Seam Bridge with your Seam [workspace](../core-concepts/workspaces/).

### **Install the Seam Bridge Application on the On-Premises Computer**

1. In a web browser, go to [the Seam Bridge releases page](https://github.com/seamapi/seam-bridge-client/releases/latest) and download the latest version of `SeamBridge.exe`.
2.  Run the downloaded `SeamBridge.exe`.

    This application opens a webpage containing the Seam Bridge settings.
3.  Click on "Create Pairing Code".\

4.  Copy the pairing code that the webpage displays.

    The installer uses this code to pair the Seam Bridge to the workspace, using a Connect Webview.\

### Pairing the Seam Bridge with Your Workspace

Seam provides two options for connecting the Seam Bridge to your workspace. If you are a developer who wants to connect your own device, see [Pair using the Seam Console](seam-bridge-in-development.md#pair-using-the-seam-console). Alternately, if you are coordinating with an external party to set up a Seam Bridge, see [Pair Using a Connect Webview](seam-bridge-in-development.md#pair-using-a-connect-webview).

#### **Pair Using the Seam Console**

1. Log in to your account on the [Seam Console](https://console.getseam.com).
2. Click **Devices** to view the **Devices** page.
3. In the upper-right corner of the **Devices** page, click **+ Add Devices**.
4. Select **Seam Bridge**.
5. In the **Bridge Name** field, type a unique name.
6. In the **PIN Code** field, type the invitation code that you copied during the [Seam Bridge application installation](seam-bridge-in-development.md#install-the-seam-bridge-application-on-the-on-premises-computer).
7. Make sure to remember the name of the Seam Network for future reference.\
   You must use this Seam Network name when connecting the on-premises access control system in a Connect Webview.

#### **Pair Using a Connect Webview**

First, perform the following steps:

1. Create a Connect Webview using `seam_bridge` as the `accepted_providers` key.
2. Share the following two pieces of information with your end user:
   * The `url` of the created Connect Webview
   * The invitation code that you copied during the [Seam Bridge application installation](seam-bridge-in-development.md#install-the-seam-bridge-application-on-the-on-premises-computer)

Next, your end user performs the following steps:

1. The end user accesses the Connect Webview and chooses **Seam Bridge** from the list of brands, if available.
2. In the **Bridge Name** field, the end user types a unique name.
3. In the **PIN Code** field, the end user types the invitation code that you copied during the [Seam Bridge application installation](seam-bridge-in-development.md#install-the-seam-bridge-application-on-the-on-premises-computer).
4. The end user must remember the name of the Seam Network for future reference.\
   They must use this Seam Network name when connecting their on-premises access control system in a Connect Webview.

## Connecting the On-Premises Software System

After installing the Seam Bridge application and connecting the Seam Bridge to your workspace, connect your on-premises software system to Seam using a Connect Webview. For detailed instructions on how to connect your system, see the setup instructions in the appropriate brand-specific guide within the [Device Guides](broken-reference) section.
